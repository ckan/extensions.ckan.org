ckanext-repo
============

Shows information about the HEAD (branch and latest commit) your ckan
and extension repositories are running on. This is done checking the
local repositories on your server.

Install
-------

With your virtualenv activated:

    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-repo.git
    cd ckanext-repo
    python setup.py develop

Add the following plugin to your CKAN ini file:

    ckan.plugins = ... repo_info

After restarting your server you should see a snippet with the CKAN
repository information added to your footer.

Configuration
-------------

By default the extension will only show information about the core
`ckan` repo.

You can choose which repositories to get information from with the
`ckanext.repo.repos` configuration option. This one expects a
space-separated list of local repositories to check, in the form
`<github_org>/<github_repo>`. If the `github_org` part is not provided,
`ckan` is assumed. For instance:

    ckanext.repo.repos = ckan okfn/ckanext-glasgow ckanext-oauth2waad ckanapi

You can also specify the location where the CKAN sources are installed
with `ckanext.repo.srcpath` configuration option. For instance:
ckanext.repo.srcpath = /usr/src
