ckanext-openapi
===============

This CKAN Extension creates an OpenAPI (aka Swagger) view that is
accessible for previewing OpenAPI JSON resources.

1.  Pre-Installation

1.1 Create a new resource format in CKAN called 'openapi-json' using
these instructions:

    1.1.1. Get the id for resource_format:

    GET /api/action/vocabulary_show?id=resource_format

    The request should return a json object with id in result, you'll need the value associated with the id key.

    1.1.2. Create a POST for tag_create:

    POST /api/action/tag_create
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: <user api key>

    {
        "vocabulary_id": "<id value from the first step>",
        "name": "openapi-json"
    }

    If all goes well, the request should return something like this:

    {
        "help": "http://10.1.0.2:5000/packages?ver=%2F1&name=tag_create&logic_function=help_show", 
        "success": true, 
        "result": {
            "vocabulary_id": "a42b7f16-b269-46c1-9464-98edc903fa81", 
            "packages": [], 
            "display_name": "openapi-json", 
            "id": "a3d45295-4fe8-4b64-8de0-d1e43e45a6e2", 
            "name": "openapi-json"
        }
    }
