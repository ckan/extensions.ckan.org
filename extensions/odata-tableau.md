ckanext-odata
=============

This CKAN extension provides a basic OData 3.0 endpoint for CKAN. This
allows it to talk to tools like [Microsoft Power
BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) and the **FREE** [Tableau
Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) for [awesome visualizations using
data from CKAN](http://data.beta.nyc/showcase?tags=tableau)!

The endpoint requires data to be held in the CKAN Datastore. An *OData
Endpoint* link is added to resources, showing up as an additional
endpoint when the Data API button is pressed.

Usage
-----

This fork supports the following [OData
parameters](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/odata-version-3-0-core-protocol/):

-   $skip - number of records to skip from top (default: 0)
-   $top - number of records to return (default:500)

The OData standard also specifies support for the **$filter** clause.
However, implementing one is non-trivial as its a dialect that doesn't
directly map to PostgreSQL.

Instead, we implemented a **$sqlfiter** clause, where the user can
specify a PostgreSQL where clause. In our view, this is actually a more
powerful implementation as the user has full access to PostgreSQL's
filtering capabilities which is a superset of the OData $filter clause.

**Note:** $sqlfilter is mutually exclusive to the $skip and $top
parameters, as you can specify skip/top functionality using SQL
primitives (e.g. [$top -&gt; limit in SQL; $skip -&gt; offset in
SQL](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/queries-limit.html))

Installation
------------

Installation as standard for CKAN. This extension can be enabled by
adding `odata` to the `plugin` line in the CKAN configuration file.
