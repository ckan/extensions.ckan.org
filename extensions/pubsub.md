\[WIP\] ckanext-pubsub
======================

THIS PLUGIN IS CURRENTLY UNFINISHED.
------------------------------------

Intro
-----

ckanext-pubsub is a [CKAN](http://ckan.org) extension that notifies user
when datasets change or new ones are added. It does this in one of three
ways:

-   You can add some words, and when a new dataset is added, if it
    matches some percentage of the terms - you get email.
-   You can choose to *watch* specific datasets, and get notified when
    they change via email.
-   It notifies a
    [pubsubhubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) server
    whenever a dataset is published, or substantially modified \[1\]
    with a link to the Atom feed.

Installation
------------

To install this extension you should first activate the virtualenv that
runs your CKAN instance and then run the following command.

     pip install -e git+https://github.com/rossjones/ckanext-pubsub.git#egg=ckanext-pubsub

For development you should check out the code into a useful location as
follows (again, as long as the virtualenv is activated)

     git clone git://github.com/rossjones/ckanext-pubsub.git
     cd ckanext-pubsub
     python setup.py develop

Configuration
-------------

Add the plugin to the ckan.plugins setting in your CKAN .ini file

    ckan.plugins = â€¦ subpub

Restart your web-server, probably apache

    sudo apache2ctl restart

Testing
-------

To run the tests for ckanext-pubsub you should run the following command
from the folder where you installed ckanext-subpub. This is only really
useful if you installed by cloning from git.

    nosetests

Is it any good?
---------------

No. It currently does nothing.

\[1\] A new resource added, for instance
