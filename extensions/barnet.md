ckanext-barnet
==============

Config, Extensions, and Themes for the Open Barnet CKAN Portal.

**Note**: This extension requires the `release-v2.2.1-barnet` branch
from
<a href="https://github.com/okfn/ckan-barnet" class="uri">https://github.com/okfn/ckan-barnet</a>
(contains a fix to allow custom dataset fields and "free extras" to be
used at the same time, back-ported to 2.2.1). Once CKAN 2.3 is released
the Barnet sites can be upgraded to it and won't need a custom branch
anymore.
