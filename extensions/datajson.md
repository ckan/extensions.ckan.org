[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA/ckanext-datajson.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA/ckanext-datajson)

A CKAN extension containing plugins `datajson`. First is used by
<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/" class="uri">http://catalog.data.gov/</a>
to harvest data sources from a remote /data.json file according to the
U.S. Project Open Data metadata specification
(<a href="https://resources.data.gov/schemas/dcat-us/v1.1/" class="uri">https://resources.data.gov/schemas/dcat-us/v1.1/</a>).

Plugin `datajson` provides a harvester to import datasets from other
remote /data.json files. See below for setup instructions.

And the plugin also provides a new view to validate /data.json files at
<a href="http://ckanhostname/pod/validate" class="uri">http://ckanhostname/pod/validate</a>.

Features
--------

*TODO*

Three plugins are provided.

-   **datajson** provides data.json export and DCAT-US metadata UI
    integration
-   **datajson\_harvest** extends
    [ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest/) to
    collect metadata from remote data.json sources
-   **cmsdatanav\_harvest** *???*

Usage
-----

### Requirements

-   [ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest/)

This extension is compatible with these versions of CKAN.

| CKAN version | Compatibility                                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| &lt;=2.7     | no                                                                  |
| 2.8          | yes                                                                 |
| 2.9          | [in progress](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-ckan-multi/issues/564) |

### Installation

To install, activate your CKAN virtualenv, install dependencies, and
install the module in develop mode, which just puts the directory in
your Python path.

    . path/to/pyenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

Then in your CKAN .ini file, add `datajson` to your ckan.plugins line:

    ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) datajson

That's the plugin for /data.json output. To make the harvester
available, also add:

    ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) harvest datajson_harvest

If you're running CKAN via WSGI, we found a strange Python dependency
bug. It might only affect development environments. The fix was to
revise wsgi.py and add:

    import ckanext

before

    from paste.deploy import loadapp

Then restart your server and check out:

    http://yourdomain.com/data.json
       and
    http://yourdomain.com/data.jsonld
       and
    http://yourdomain.com/pod/validate

### Caching /data.json

If you're deploying inside Apache, some caching would be a good idea
because generating the /data.json file can take a good few moments.
Enable the cache modules:

    a2enmod cache
    a2enmod disk_cache

And then in your Apache configuration add:

    CacheEnable disk /data.json
    CacheRoot /tmp/apache_cache
    CacheDefaultExpire 120
    CacheMaxFileSize 50000000
    CacheIgnoreCacheControl On
    CacheIgnoreNoLastMod On
    CacheStoreNoStore On

And be sure to create /tmp/apache\_cache and make it writable by the
Apache process.

### Generating /data.json Off-Line

Generating this file is a little slow, so an alternative instead of
caching is to generate the file periodically (e.g. in a cron job). In
that case, you'll want to change the path that CKAN generates the file
at to something *other* than /data.json. In your CKAN .ini file, in the
app:main section, add:

    ckanext.datajson.path = /internal/data.json

Now create a crontab file ("mycrontab") to download this URL to a file
on disk every ten minutes:

    0-59/10 * * * * wget -qO /path/to/static/data.json http://localhost/internal/data.json

And activate your crontab like so:

    crontab mycrontab

In Apache, we'll want to block outside access to the "internal" URL, and
also map the URL /data.json to the static file. In your httpd.conf, add:

    Alias /data.json /path/to/static/data.json

    <Location /internal/>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from 127.0.0.1
        Deny from all
    </Location>

And then restart Apache. Wait for the cron job to run once, then check
if /data.json loads (and it should be fast!). Also double check that
<a href="http://yourdomain.com/internal/data.json" class="uri">http://yourdomain.com/internal/data.json</a>
gives a 403 forbidden error when accessed from some other location.

### Configuration

You can customize the URL that generates the data.json output:

    ckanext.datajson.path = /data.json
    ckanext.datajsonld.path = /data.jsonld
    ckanext.datajsonld.id = http://www.youragency.gov/data.json

You can enable or disable the Data.json output by setting

    ckanext.datajson.url_enabled = False

If ckanext.datajsonld.path is omitted, it defaults to replacing ".json"
in your ckanext.datajson.path path with ".jsonld", so it probably won't
need to be specified.

The option ckanext.datajsonld.id is the @id value used to identify the
data catalog itself. If not given, it defaults to ckan.site\_url.

### Harvesting

To use the data.json harvester, you'll also need to set up the CKAN
harvester extension. See the CKAN harvester README at
<a href="https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-harvest" class="uri">https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-harvest</a>
for how to do that. You'll set some configuration variables and then
initialize the CKAN harvester plugin using:

    paster --plugin=ckanext-harvest harvester initdb --config=/path/to/ckan.ini

Now you can set up a new DataJson harvester by visiting:

    http://yourdomain.com/harvest

And when configuring the data source, just choose "/data.json" as the
source type.

**The next paragraph assumes you're using my fork of the CKAN harvest
extension at
<a href="https://github.com/JoshData/ckanext-harvest" class="uri">https://github.com/JoshData/ckanext-harvest</a>**

In the configuration field, you can put a YAML string containing
defaults for fields that may not be set in the source data.json files,
e.g. enter something like this:

    defaults:
      Agency: Department of Health & Human Services
      Author: Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration
      author_id: http://healthdata.gov/id/agency/samhsa

This again is tied to the HealthData.gov metadata schema.

Development
-----------

### Setup

Build the docker containers.

    $ make build

Start the docker containers.

    $ make up

CKAN will start at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

Clean up any containers and volumes.

    $ make down

Open a shell to run commands in the container.

    $ docker-compose exec ckan bash

If you're unfamiliar with docker-compose, see our
[cheatsheet](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Docker-Best-Practices#cheatsheet)
and the [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).

For additional make targets, see the help.

    $ make help

### Testing

They follow the guidelines for [testing CKAN
extensions](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/extensions/testing-extensions.html#testing-extensions).

To run the extension tests, start the containers with `make up`, then:

    $ make test

Lint the code.

    $ make lint

### Matrix builds

The existing development environment assumes a full catalog.data.gov
test setup. This makes it difficult to develop and test against new
versions of CKAN (or really any dependency) because everything is
tightly coupled and would require us to upgrade everything at once which
doesn't really work. A new make target `test-new` is introduced with a
new docker-compose file.

The "new" development environment drops as many dependencies as
possible. It is not meant to have feature parity with
[GSA/catalog.data.gov](https://github.com/GSA/catalog.data.gov/). Tests
should mock external dependencies where possible.

In order to support multiple versions of CKAN, or even upgrade to new
versions of CKAN, we support development and testing through the
`CKAN_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ make CKAN_VERSION=2.8 test
    $ make CKAN_VERSION=2.9 test

Legacy nose tests are still supported. You must specify
`COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.legacy.yml` when interacting with this
environment.

    $ make COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.legacy.yml up
    $ make COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.legacy.yml test-legacy

| Variable      | Description                              | Default            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| CKAN\_VERSION | Version of CKAN to use.                  | 2.8                |
| COMPOSE\_FILE | docker-compose service description file. | docker-compose.yml |
