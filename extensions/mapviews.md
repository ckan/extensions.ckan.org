![Pakistan choropleth map](doc/img/pakistan.png)

This extension adds regular and choropleth maps to CKAN, using the new
Resource View being developed on CKAN's master branch (currently
unreleased).

It uses [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com), which is compatible with all
major browsers (including IE7+).

Installation
------------

Clone this repository and run `python setup.py install`. Then add
`navigablemap` and/or `choroplethmap` to the list in `ckan.plugins` in
your CKAN config file.

Restart your webserver. You should see the new "Navigable Map" and/or
"Choropleth Map" chart types (depending on which plugins you added to
the list) as options in the view type's list on any resource that's in
the DataStore.

Usage
-----

### Pre-requisites

To start creating choropleth maps, you need two things: the data you
want to plot, and a GeoJSON defining the geographical regions you'd like
to plot it. The data itself needs to be in a resource inside the
DataStore, and the map needs to be in the same domain as CKAN itself (to
avoid [same-origin
policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) issues). The
easiest way to do so is to upload the GeoJSON as another resource.

Each GeoJSON feature needs a property related to a column in the data.
It can be an id, name, or anythings that uniquely identifies that
feature, so we know where to plot the data.

### Example

We'll create a map to try to understand the internet usage across the
world. To do so, we need a worldmap in GeoJSON and the internet usage
data.

A good source of GeoJSON files is the [Natural Earth
Data](http://naturalearthdata.com/) website. We'll be using their [world
map at 1:110 million
scale](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/master/geojson/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson).

We'll be plotting the [Internet usage per 100 people in
2012](doc/internet-users-per-100-people.csv) all across the world. The
data comes from the great [World Bank's Data
Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx). It looks like this:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 15%" />
<col style="width: 13%" />
<col style="width: 34%" />
<col style="width: 15%" />
<col style="width: 17%" />
<col style="width: 3%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Country Name</th>
<th>Country Code</th>
<th>Indicator Name</th>
<th>Indicator Code</th>
<th>2012</th>
<th>...</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Afghanistan</td>
<td>AFG</td>
<td>Internet users (per 100 people)</td>
<td>IT.NET.USER.P2</td>
<td>5.45454545454545</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Albania</td>
<td>ALB</td>
<td>Internet users (per 100 people)</td>
<td>IT.NET.USER.P2</td>
<td>54.6559590399494</td>

<td>DZA</td>

<td>IT.NET.USER.P2</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>American Samoa</td>
<td>ASM</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td>Internet users (per 100 people)</td>
<td>IT.NET.USER.P2</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To identify each country, we have its name and code. We need to have
either attribute in the GeoJSON feature's properties. Opening that file,
we see:

``` javascript
{
  "features": [
    {
      "geometry": {
        "coordinates": [
          // ...
        ],
        "type": "Polygon"
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "Afghanistan",
        "region_un": "Asia",
        "region_wb": "South Asia",
        "wb_a3": "AFG",
        // ...
      },
      "type": "Feature"
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

We can map either `Country Name` with `name`, or `Country Code` with
`wb_a3`. Let's use the country code.

In your CKAN instance, create a new dataset (i.e. "World Bank's
Indicators"), and upload two resources: the GeoJSON and the data file.

Go to the data file's manage resource page and create a new
`Choropleth Map` view. You'll see a form with a few fields. Use
"Internet usage across the globe" as a title, leave the description
empty (if you want). Now we need to add the GeoJSON.

Select in the `GeoJSON Resource` field the resource you just created.
The `GeoJSON Key Field` should be `wb_a3`, as we found out before. We'll
link that field to the `Country Code` column in our data, so set it in
the `Key` field.

Now, we just need to select what value we want to plot (let's use the
latest year, in the `2012` column), and what label to use
(`Country Name`). You can leave the remaining fields blank. In the end,
we'll have:

| Attribute         | Value                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| GeoJSON Resource  | *(Your GeoJSON Resource's name)* |
| GeoJSON Key Field | wb\_a3                           |
| Key               | Country Code                     |
| Value             | 2012                             |
| Label             | Country Name                     |
| Redirect to URL   |                                  |
| Fields            |                                  |

Click on `Preview` and you should see a map like:

![Worldwide Internet usage](doc/img/worldwide-internet-usage.png)

Congratulations! You've just created your first choropleth map. You can
go ahead and see how the maps look like in other years. We can't compare
the maps directly, as the scales change depending on the data, but the
difference from 2000 to 2012 is still impressive.

### Filters

If the map is shown in places other than its original URL in the
resource view's list (for example, inside a
[ckanext-dashboard](//github.com/ckan/ckanext-dashboard) or
[ckanext-page](//github.com/ckan/ckanext-pages)), its regions become
clickable.

When the user clicks on a region, we'll add a filter to the current page
using the `Key` attribute. Using the previous example, if I clicked on
Brazil, it'll add the filters `Country Code:BRA` to the current page.

The user can deactivate the filters by clicking on the same region
again, and can activate multiple filters.

If you'd like to, when clicking on a region, redirect the user to
another page with that filter set (for example, another resource view or
a dashboard), you can add the target URL to the `Redirect to URL` field.
If that's left blank, it'll simply add filters to the current page.
