CKAN ckanext-ngsiview
=====================

CKAN extension that will give you the ability to generate real-time
resources provided by a Context broker. Some resources may need your IDM
token, so you must be logged in to be able to see those resources
properly.

**Note**: This extension has been tested in CKAN 2.2 and 2.3. It may not
work in other versions.

Requirements
------------

-   [OAuth2 CKAN
    Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2/). OAuth2
    CKAN Extension. This extension might be needed since some the
    requests sent to the ContextBroker must include the OAuth2
    credentials to identify the user that is creating the offering.

Installation
------------

Install this extension in your CKAN is instance is as easy as install
any other CKAN extension.

-   Download the source from this GitHub repo.
-   Activate your virtual environment (generally by running
    `. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`)
-   Install the extension by running `python setup.py develop`
-   Modify your configuration file (generally in
    `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `ngsiview` to the
    `ckan.plugins` and to ckan.views.default\_views.
-   Restart your apache server (`sudo service apache2 restart`)

How it works?
-------------

The way to create a NGSI resource is fairly simple:

1.  Firstly you have to access to the resource create section and choose
    the option Link.

2.  Fill the URL field with a Context Broker query, if your query is a
    convenience operation, you only have to fill the URL field with it.
    If instead, it is a standard operation query, you have to do an
    additional step after create the resource in order to add a payload
    to de query. You can control the results pagination at the same way
    that in a common Context Broker query.

3.  Complete the Format field with ngsi9 or ngsi10 and click on add
    resource. This is an important step, and without it the extension
    wonâ€™t do anything with your resource.

4.  Finally set the OAuth-token field to required if you are working
    with Orion ContextBroker at
    <a href="http://orion.lab.fiware.org:1026" class="uri">http://orion.lab.fiware.org:1026</a>.
    Additionally you can also manage the
    [tenant](https://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Publish/Subscribe_Broker_-_Orion_Context_Broker_-_User_and_Programmers_Guide#Multi_service_tenancy)
    and the [service
    path](https://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Publish/Subscribe_Broker_-_Orion_Context_Broker_-_User_and_Programmers_Guide#Entity_service_paths)
    as the same way that it is explained at Orion Context Broker
    documentation.

    If your query is a convenience type, your resource has already been
    created, on the contrary if it is a standard operation you have to
    do the next step.

5.  Standard operations only: Click on manage to edit your resource, now
    an additional field has appeared, complete it with a payload and
    click on update to save your query payload.

Upcoming features -----------------

Ckanext-ngsiview is being adapted to allow to load and preview of
historic data provided by STH, the new format associated to that kind of
resources is named as ngsi-h.

By now there isn't a stable version of STH, and its API may be modified,
but the intention is to keep the same structure and data creation
process that an standard ngsi resource.
