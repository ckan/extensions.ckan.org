ckanext-repeating
=================

This extension provides a way to store repeating fields in CKAN
datasets, resources, organizations and groups.

Add the `repeating` plugin to your ckan.plugins configuration settings
and use ckanext-scheming or a custom form plugin to use the provided
validators to store repeating values in metadata fields.

The easiest way to use repeating fields is with
[ckanext-scheming](https://github.com/open-data/ckanext-scheming/). Add
`ckanext.repeating:presets.json` to your scheming.presets configuration
settings:

``` json
scheming.presets = ckanext.scheming:presets.json
                   ckanext.repeating:presets.json
```

A repeating field in a scheming schema will look something like:

``` json
{
  "field_name": "authors",
  "preset": "repeating_text",
  "label": "Author",
  "form_blanks": 3
}
```

This new extra field "authors" will appear as multiple fields in the
dataset form, with three blank values below existing values. by the
[form
snippet](ckanext/repeating/templates/scheming/form_snippets/repeating_text.html).

![Example of repeating form snippet](docs/repeating-form.png)

When displayed, each value for the text entered will appear separately
by the [display
snippet](ckanext/repeating/templates/scheming/display_snippets/repeating_text.html),
eg.:

![Example of repeating display snippet](docs/repeating-display.png)

When the dataset is accessed from the API each value will appear and are
updated as items in a list, eg.:

\`\`\`json { "...": "...", "authors": \[ "Person One", "Person Two" \],
"...": "..." }
