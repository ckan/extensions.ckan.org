CKAN External Link Extension
============================

**CKAN Version:** &gt;= 2.0

This extension will add pop-up message as tooltip for external URLs.
Administrator will be able to add websites to whitelist from UI.

Installation
------------

Install the extension as usual, and edit ckan configuration ini file to
add or append the plugin:

      ckan.plugins = extlink

White list
----------

By default all links except for those from the site's own domain will be
treated as external links, and will have a pop-up message as tooltip
when mouse hovered. Site administrators can go to
<a href="http://yourdomain.site/extlink" class="uri">http://yourdomain.site/extlink</a>
to add domains to white list, so that those domain links will not be
treated as external links. For example:

    .mil, data.gov
    reisys.com
    reisystems.com

At the same page administrators can also customize the pop-up message.
