\#Tidoop This project is part of [FIWARE](http://fiware.org), being part
of the
[Cosmos](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/bigdata-analysis-cosmos)
Ecosystem.

Tidoop is the code name for all the developments about
[Hadoop](LINK_REQUIRED) made by [FIWARE](LINK_REQUIRED) team at
[Telefónica Investigación y Desarrollo](LINK_REQUIRED) (Telefónica
Research and Development, in english), or <i>TID</i> in its abreviated
form.

Tidoop comprises several different projects:

-   API extensions for Hadoop, under
    [tidoop-api-ext](tidoop-hadoop-ext/) folder.
-   MapReduce job library, under [tidoop-mr-lib](tidoop-mr-lib/) folder.
-   REST API for the above MapReduce job library, under
    [tidoop-mr-lib-api](tidoop-mr-lib-api) folder.

\#\#Reporting issues and contact information There are several channels
suited for reporting issues and asking for doubts in general. Each one
depends on the nature of the question:

-   Use [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for specific
    questions about the software. Typically, these will be related to
    installation problems, errors and bugs. Development questions when
    forking the code are welcome as well. Use the `fiware-tidoop` tag.
-   Use <fiware-tech-help@lists.fi-ware.org> for general questions about
    the software. Typically, these will be related to the conceptual
    usage of the component, e.g. wether it suites for your project or
    not. It is worth to mention the issues reported to
    <fiware-tech-help@lists.fi-ware.org> are tracked under
    <http://jira.fiware.org>; use this Jira to see the status of the
    issue, who has been assigneed to, the exchanged emails, etc,
    nevertheless the answers will be sent to you via email too.
-   Personal email:
    -   <francisco.romerobueno@telefonica.com> **\[Main contributor\]**
    -   [fermin.galanmarquez@telefonica.com](fermin.galanmarquez@telefonica.com)
        **\[Main contributor\]**
    -   [german.torodelvalle@telefonica.com](german.torodelvalle@telefonica.com)
        **\[Contributor\]**

**NOTE**: Please try to avoid personaly emailing the contributors unless
they ask for it. In fact, if you send a private email you will probably
receive an automatic response enforcing you to use
[stackoverflow.com](stackoverflow.com) or
<fiware-tech-help@lists.fi-ware.org>. This is because using the
mentioned methods will create a public database of knowledge that can be
useful for future users; private email is just private and cannot be
shared.
