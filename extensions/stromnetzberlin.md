ckanext-stromnetzberlin
=======================

A CKAN extension for harvesting Stromnetz Berlin.

### Dependencies

The harvester relies on a group import feature, which is currently not
implemented in the `ckanext-harvest`. Therefore a
[fork](https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/ckanext-harvest) with a
feature branch is used as the dependency instead.

Getting Started
---------------

If you are using Python virtual environment (virtualenv), activate it.

    $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/ckanext-stromnetzberlin.git#egg=ckanext-stromnetzberlin
    $ cd /path/to/virtualenv/src/ckanext-stromnetzberlin
    $ pip install -r pip-requirements
    $ python setup.py develop

    $ cd /path/to/virtualenv/src/ckanext-harvest
    $ pip install -r pip-requirements
    $ python setup.py develop

Add the following plugins to your CKAN configuration file:

    ckan.plugins = harvest stromnetz_harvester

Please make sure, that the CKAN process will have access to the logfile
specified in
`/path/to/virtualenv/src/ckanext-stromnetzberlin/ckanext/stromnetzberlin/config.ini`.
After restarting CKAN the plugins should be ready to use.
