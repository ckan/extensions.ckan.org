ckan4j
======

A java library to extend and access core functionalities of CKAN.

Why a CKAN java library
-----------------------

[CKAN](http://ckan.org) is a complete and performant open-source Data
Management System (DMS) built in Python and maintained by a quite large
community leaded by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/).
It powers many data catalogs across the globe including
[datahub.io](http://datahub.io),
[catalog.data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov) and
[data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/data/search) among many other sites.
CKAN provide a well designed and powerful [RPC-style
API](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html) that expose
pratically all its core functionalities but when it comes to integration
with Java based or enterprise scale applications it present some lack of
support. So, when we built the
[opendatahub.it](http://www.opendatahub.it) federated catalog of Italian
open dataset we decided to create a Java based client library and
extension to CKAN to ease such integration and to decouple the portal
and data harvester architecture (based on Java tecnologies like
[Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and
[Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/)) from the CKAN itself.
ckan4j is the core library of such work released as open-source so that
many other can benefit from it

Features
--------

ckan4j is a Java client library that provide access to the CKAN core
functionalities and APIs using Java language. The key difference respect
other Java libraries for CKAN is the extension architecture which is
designed not only to act as a java client of a CKAN but also to extend
the CKAN API adding specific enterprise grade functionalities like:

-   Social Login (supported GitHub, Google+ and Facebook). It include
    capabilities to implement SSO with many other portal software
-   CKAN dataset and organizations statistics exposed as API
-   CKAN tags statistics and classification data dump in JSON structures
    ready for [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) visualizations
-   CKAN Database extension helper (direct access to CKAN data and
    manipulation of custom tables)
-   Seamless integration with java classification libraries and semantic
    tools

Usage
-----

ckan4j is distributed as an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) based
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. Once you build it, you can
use it in webapps or generic Java client apps adding the jar to the
classpath (it is not yet published on a Maven repo). If you are
interested on a reference implementation for a web api, you can give a
look to [ckan4j-webapi](https://github.com/sciamlab/ckan4j-webapi).

Dependencies
------------

ckan4j require the SciamLab
[common-lib](https://github.com/sciamlab/common-lib)

Contribute
----------

SciamLab is maintaining the library but we are happy to consider your
feedbacks and contributions and we want this to be the result of a
community effort. To partecipate you can simply fork the repo and follow
the typical GitHub flow considering that every pull request must be
associated with an issue on GitHub You can collaborate with
