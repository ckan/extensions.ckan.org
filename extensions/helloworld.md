README
------

This CKAN plugin exists only for demonstration purposes. It basically
demonstrates how to:

-   extend core dataset metadata schema with a couple of new fields:
    -   a string field "music-genre" taking values from a restricred
        vocabulary
    -   a string field "music-title" as free text
-   theme dataset forms to take into account these new fields.
-   create a helloworld-specific paster command
