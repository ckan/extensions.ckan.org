More documentation available in
[ckanext/surrey/docs/customization.md](ckanext/surrey/docs/customization.md)

Prerequisite
------------

This extension needs the stats extension to be activated with the
tracking options. Some links (in the footer), also need the ckanext-page
extension. So install
[ckanext-page](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-pages)

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-pages.git#egg=ckanext-pages

Then configure the plugins in the .ini file:

    ckan.plugins =  ... stats pages...
    ckan.tracking_enabled = true 

The template need the follow pages to be created:

-   faq
-   glossary
-   open-government-licence
-   city-of-surrey-open-data-api

In order to refresh the most popular dataset values on the landing page,
make sure to set up the cron jobs (see below).

The extension has been developed and tested to run with CKAN 2.2.

Installation
------------

Activate your pyenv and go to the CKAN root, for example:

     cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/
     source bin/activate
     cd src/ckan

Install the extension from GitHub:

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/CityofSurrey/ckanext-surrey.git#egg=ckanext-surrey

To access a specific release, for example release-1.0:

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/CityofSurrey/ckanext-surrey.git@release-1.0#egg=ckanext-surrey

Add the extension in the configuration file. `surrey` does most of the
work, `surreyfacet` mainly removes the organization from the facet menu

    ckan.plugins =  ... surrey surreyfacet surreyextrapages

Add the custom licence file in the configuration file.

    licenses_group_url = file:///path/to/extension/ckanext-surrey/ckanext/surrey/licences.json

Custom settings
---------------

### IP Whitelist

The extension has the ability to control access to protected datasets
via a whitelist which can be set via the admin panel.

The admin panel field will accept either an IP address (1.2.3.4), an IP
range (1.2.3.4/8), or a combination. If you are granting access to
multiple IPs or IP ranges, list them separated by a space, a comma, or a
semicomma.

Set up jobs
-----------

Some cron jobs have to be set up in order to have the extension working
as expected.

In order to update the recent visits, the tracker and the index has to
be rebuilt. The following command will do this using `crontab -e` (make
sure that the path to `paster` and the .ini file correspond to your
installation):

    @hourly /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/paster --plugin=ckan tracking update -c /etc/ckan/default/production.ini > /dev/null
    @hourly /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/paster --plugin=ckan search-index rebuild -r -c /etc/ckan/default/production.ini > /dev/null

In order to receive mail notification (either for the admin and for the
users who are registering) add the following comming in the cron jobs:

    @daily echo '{}' | /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/paster --plugin=ckan post -c /etc/ckan/default/production.ini /api/action_notifications > /dev/null
