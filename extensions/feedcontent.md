Feed Extension
==============

The Feed extension allows site administrators to include blog entries in
the main content of templates using named references to atom or rss
feeds.

**Note: This extension requires ckan 1.7 or higher**

Activating and Installing
-------------------------

To install the plugin, enter your virtualenv and load the source::

(pyenv)$ git install -e
hg+<a href="https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-feedcontent#egg=ckanext-feedcontent" class="uri">https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-feedcontent#egg=ckanext-feedcontent</a>

This will also register a plugin entry point, so you now should be able
to add the following to your CKAN .ini file::

ckan.plugins = feed\_content <other-plugins>

**At this point nothing will have happened**! To add feeds to your
system see below.

Running the tests
-----------------

You can run the tests from the root of this repository with the
following command

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test-core.ini ckanext/feedcontent/tests/

Using the Extension
-------------------

### Adding feeds

To add feeds to CKAN you should log on as a system administrator and
then visit /feed/ from where you will be able to add a new feed or edit
an existing one. When you need to update a feed you should visit /feed/
from where you will be able to view the feed to be updated and then
press the update button.

### Setting up the example

Go to the url of your CKAN instance, and go to /feed/ where you should
add a new feed with a title of 'ckan' (without the quotes), a url of
'<a href="http://ckan.org/feed" class="uri">http://ckan.org/feed</a>'
and tick the HTML Entries checkbox.

Add the following line to your configuration

    ckan.feed.demo = yes

Point your browser to the home page of your CKAN instance. This simple
example shows in ckanext/feedcontent/templates/example/home.html how the
feed items can be included.

### Using feeds

To reference a feed and add an entry in a template you should use the
feed\_entry helper and provide it both the name of the feed (name, not
title, is the one shown in the URL as a slug) and a regular expression
for the title it should match.

In the following example it fetches (and renders) the entry which ends
with 'watch the data'.

    ${h.feed_entry("ckan", ".*watch the data$")}

As feeds do not auto-update, if you wish to update the feed you should
do so using the option on the /feed/ page or the individual view page,
for example /feed/ckan (if you had following the example setup steps
above).

### Configuring snippets for presentation

When using feed entries within a template, it is necessary to specify
how the entry will be rendered. By default this uses a simple template
within ckanext\\feedcontent\\templates but the default can be overridden
by setting the 'ckan.feeds.default.snippet' setting to point to a
template within the configured template paths.

As feeds are created they can also have the template file specified as
long as the template can be found in the template path.

The template path itself can be added to using the config option called
'extra\_template\_paths', see the docs for more information but it could
be configured as follows assuming a feeditem.html in /var/ckan/extras.

    extra_template_paths = /var/ckan/extras
    ckan.feed.default.snippet = feeditem.html

The only other configuration option is the
'ckan.feeds.short\_description.size' setting which will allow the user
to set the size of a new short\_description field that is passed through
to the template. By default this is 200 characters.
