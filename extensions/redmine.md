ckanext-redmine
===============

This is an extension that provides a contact form for users to contact
you about different categories of problems, backed by a
[redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) installation.

Features
--------

This extension provides:

### Contact form

This (defaults to /contact) that allows a user to contact the data
portal owners and send feedback/questions to various redmine
installations. Each installation can be made available at a URL to cover
different types of reports. For instance on data.gov.uk /contact and
/content/general put data into one redmine instance, /contact/location
puts the issues in another.

The categories drop-down is populated with the categories from the named
Redmine instance and so these should be created within Redmine itself
(optionally with a default assignee).

In this version of the extension all submitted issues are private (at
least if Redmine is configured to be private) and they are not shown on
the data portal.

Failure to add the issue to redmine will trigger an email to a system
administrator to containing the contact information (so that details are
not lost).

### Simple contact-report

This shows the number of open/closed tickets with links to the youngest
and oldest tickets in each state. The table below shows the number of
open/closed tickets for each category and provides a link directly to
the Redmine view filtered by that category. This view is only accessible
to system administrators.

Configuration
-------------

1.  Create a project, some categories and add a user to redmine. Go to
    /settings and click on Authentication and make sure Enable REST web
    service is checked.

2.  Add `redmine` to your ckan.plugins.

3.  Copy redmine-config-simple.json to where you put your config files
    and file in the required fields (for the number of instances you
    want to connect to). For each instance specify a name and fill in
    the fields as follows:

<!-- -->

     -  url - The web address of your redmine installation 
     
     -  apikey - The API key of a user with permission to create 
        issues, this can be found at /my/account on your 
        installation, you should click 'Show' underneath the API 
        access key section on the right.
     
     -  project - This is the short name of the project, for 
        instance a project called "Issues Test" will end up 
        with a short-name like issues-test.  You can see this 
        in the browser address bar when you visit it in redmine.
     
     - error_email - The email address of a user (or several) 
       to be notified when contact fails
     
     - default - A boolean specifying whether this instance should
       be the one displayed at /contact

1.  Add the following entry to your ckan .ini file.

<!-- -->

    ckanext.redmine.config = path_to_config_file

Future
------

#### Spam checking

The extension should use mollom (or suchlike) to check for spam
submissions.

#### Custom fields

Extension should take advantage of the custom fields to record the
relevant dataset/publisher so that issues can be grouped/queried on that
data. Currently this is inline in the issue content.

#### Fuller reports

More reports on the processing of issues. Charts of velocity based on
issue state, changes of state and grouped by publisher/dataset.

#### User tracking of issues

Users should be able to view, on the site, issues that they have created
and be able to respond to them (with their feedback being added to
Redmine).

#### Publisher access to issues

Publishers should be able to obtain a view that shows the issues that
are relevant to them, or are about their datasets. Eventually they
should be able to response/close issues as well.

#### Email integration

Responses to issues are likely to take place in users' inboxes, and it
would be more efficient, and valuable, if ckanext-redmine were able to
be responsible for sending the messages, and also for integrating the
responses. This may require new forms for responding to issues and
delivering/retrieving email on each item.
