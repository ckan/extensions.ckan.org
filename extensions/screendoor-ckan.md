Screendoor &lt;&gt; CKAN Integration
------------------------------------

**Note:** This integration is only available on Screendoor's [enterprise plans](https://www.dobt.co/screendoor/enterprise/).

Instead of manually releasing open data to your CKAN portal, Screendoor can sync your responses with a CKAN dataset automatically. Revisions to responses can even be reflected in your portal in real time.

### Connecting to CKAN

If you have a CKAN account, visit your project's Settings page, and select "Integrations" from the sidebar. Click "Enable" next to CKAN.

![The Integrations page.](https://github.com/dobtco/screendoor-ckan/blob/master/1.png?raw=true)

On the Connect to CKAN page, fill in the URL and API key of your CKAN data portal.

### Choosing responses to sync

Screendoor will sync all responses by default. To sync only a subset of your responses, click "Edit filters?"

![Editing sync filters.](https://github.com/dobtco/screendoor-ckan/blob/master/3.png?raw=true)

In the modal that appears, you can choose to filter responses with a specific status or label or those that contain a certain word or phrase. Press the "Filter responses" button to save your filters.

Finally, to start syncing the responses that match your filters, press the "Start syncing."
