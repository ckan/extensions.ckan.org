ckanext-highlight-related-items
===============================

Surface a dataset's related items more visibly. Normally, a dataset page
provides a text description of the dataset and then a bunch of
"resources" in various formats. For very technical users, this is
perfect. For everyone else, visualizations and applications are far more
approachable. But they're buried in the "Related" tab. This plugin
simply surfaces those items above the "resources."

which works with CKAN 2.3 and above.
