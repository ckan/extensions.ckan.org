ckanext-datapreview
===================

This extension is a modified, but local implementation of the [OKFN
dataproxy](https://github.com/okfn/dataproxy) that runs as a CKAN
extension rather than on [Google
AppEngine](http://jsonpdataproxy.appspot.com). This has been written to
improve the performance on [data.gov.uk](data.gov.uk) and increase the
maximum file size processed.

The interface to the extension::

    /data/preview/<resource_id>?max-results=N&encoding=utf-8

is not exactly the same - dataproxy requires the URL instead of the
resource id - the data returned is identical. Rather than always
fetching the data from the remote site the new controller at the above
route will first attempt to find the data in the
[ckanext-archiver](https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-archiver)'s local
archive.

Installation
------------

The most straightforward method of installation is::

    git clone git://github.com/rossjones/ckanext-datapreview.git
    cd ckanext-datapreview
    python setup.py develop

Once complete the datapreview should be added to your ckan.plugins
property in the appropriate .ini file.

Requirements
------------

-   **XLRD** - retrieved by setup.py
-   **ckanext-archiver** - for the resource cache

As this extension is based on the dataproxy it is currently using the
same old copy of brewery (0.5.0) which is not available in pypi (link
for 0.5.0 version references tip in a HG repo). It is included in this
source code repository.

Problems
--------

Currently when previewing this data with [recline.js](reclinejs.com) the
dataproxy backend has a hard-coded URL to
<a href="http://jsonpdataproxy.appspot.com" class="uri">http://jsonpdataproxy.appspot.com</a>
which means it is unable to be used with this extension.

On data.gov.uk we have patched a local copy of recline to use the new
datapreview, however a patch to the recline dataproxy backend should be
feasible.

Improvements
------------

-   Increases the limit on download size (doesn't have the appengine
    download limit)
-   When provided with a HTML file pretending to be a CSV file, it
    returns an error instead of rendering the HTML on linefeeds.
-   Uses the local archive cache if it exists rather than hitting the
    remote site.

Possible future enhancements
----------------------------

-   Render any RDF provided in a useful format for display, possibly CSV
    derived from a JSON-LD serialisation.
-   Unpacking of .zip files
