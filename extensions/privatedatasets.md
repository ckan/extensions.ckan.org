CKAN Private Datasets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets?branch=develop)
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

This CKAN extension allows a user to create private datasets that only
certain users will be able to see. When a dataset is being created, it's
possible to specify the list of users that can see this dataset. In
addition, the extension provides an HTTP API that allows to add users
programmatically.

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://www.fiware.org).

Installation
------------

Install this extension in your CKAN instance is as easy as install any
other CKAN extension.

-   Activate your virtual environment

<!-- -->

    . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

-   Install the extension by running

<!-- -->

    pip install ckanext-privatedatasets

> **Note**: If you prefer, you can also download the source code and
> install the extension manually. To do so, execute the following
> commands:
>
>     $ git clone https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets.git
>     $ cd ckanext-privatedatasets
>     $ python setup.py install

-   Modify your configuration file (generally in
    `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `privatedatasets` in the
    `ckan.plugins` property.

<!-- -->

    ckan.plugins = privatedatasets <OTHER_PLUGINS>

-   In the same config file, specify the location of your parser by
    adding the `ckan.privatedatasets.parser` setting. For example, to
    set the
    [FiWareNotificationParser](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets/blob/master/ckanext/privatedatasets/parsers/fiware.py)
    as notification parser, add the following line:
    `ckan.privatedatasets.parser = ckanext.privatedatasets.parsers.fiware:FiWareNotificationParser`.
-   If you want you can also add some preferences to set if the Acquire
    URL should be shown when the user is to create and/or editing a
    dataset:
    -   To show the Acquire URL when the user is **creating** a dataset,
        you should set the following preference:
        `ckan.privatedatasets.show_acquire_url_on_create = True`. By
        default, the value of this preference is set to `False`.
    -   To show the Acquire URL when the user is **editing** a dataset,
        you should set the following preference:
        `ckan.privatedatasets.show_acquire_url_on_edit = True`. By
        default, the value of this preference is set to `False`.
-   In some cases you will want to secure the notification callback in
    order to filter the entities (user, machines...) that can send them.
    To do so, you can follow the instructions in the section [Securing
    the Notification Callback](#securing-the-notification-callback).
-   Restart your apache2 server

<!-- -->

    sudo service apache2 restart

-   That's All!

Creating a notification parser
------------------------------

Since each service can send notifications in a different way, the
extension allows developers to create their own notifications parser. As
default, we provide you a basic parser based on the notifications sent
by the [FiWare Store](https://github.com/conwetlab/wstore/).

If you want to create your own parser, you have to:

1.  Create a class with a method called `parse_notification`. This
    method will receive one argument that will include the notification
    body.
2.  Parse the notification as you like. You can raise a CKAN's default
    exception (`ValidationError`, `ObjectNotFound`, `NotAuthorized`,
    `ValidationError`, `SearchError`, `SearchQueryError` or
    `SearchIndexError`) if you find an error parsing the notification.
3.  Return a dictionary with the structure attached below. The
    `users_datasets` is the lists of datasets available for each user
    (each element of this list is a dictionary with two fields: `user`
    and `datasets`).

<!-- -->

    {'users_datasets': [{'user': 'user_name', 'datasets': ['ds1', 'ds2', ...]},
                        {'user': 'user_name2', 'datasets': ['ds1', 'ds4', ...] }]}

Finally, you have to modify your config file and specify in the
`ckan.privatedatasets.parser` the location of your own parser.

At this point, you will be able to add users via API by accessing the
following URL:

    http://<CKAN_SERVER>:<CKAN_PORT>/api/action/dataset_acquired

Securing the Notification Callback
----------------------------------

In some cases, you are required to filter the entities (users,
machines...) that can send notifications to the notification callback.
To do so, you must relay on Client Side Verification over HTTPs, so the
first step here is to deploy your CKAN instance over HTTPs. If you
haven't already done it, you can use the following tutorial: [Starting
CKAN over
HTTPs](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2/wiki/Starting-CKAN-over-HTTPs).

Once that your CKAN instance is running over HTTPs, you have to
configure the Client Side Verification. To achieve this, the first thing
that you must do is creating an OpenSSL config file. You can use the
following one or modify it to your liking:

    [ req ]
    default_md = sha1
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name

    [ req_distinguished_name ]
    countryName = Country
    countryName_default = SP
    countryName_min = 2
    countryName_max = 2
    localityName = Locality
    localityName_default = Madrid
    organizationName = Organization
    organizationName_default = FIWARE
    commonName = Common Name
    commonName_max = 64

    [ certauth ]
    subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
    basicConstraints = CA:true
    crlDistributionPoints = @crl

    [ server ]
    basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
    keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
    extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
    nsCertType = server
    crlDistributionPoints = @crl

    [ client ]
    basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
    keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
    extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
    nsCertType = client
    crlDistributionPoints = @crl

    [ crl ]
    URI=http://testca.local/ca.crl

Then, you should create your CA using the previous config file. To do
so, you can execute the following line (replace
`<PATH_TO_SSL_CONFIG_FILE>` by the real path of your OpenSSL config
file):

    $ openssl req -config <PATH_TO_SSL_CONFIG_FILE> -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyform PEM -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 3650 -extensions certauth -outform PEM -out ca.cer

Afterwards, you will need to filter the notification callback to be
callable only by those entities that use a valid certificate (the one
signed by the CA created previously). To achieve this, edit the file
`/etc/apache2/sites-available/ckan_default` and add the following lines
immediately after the SSL configuration (replace
`<PATH_TO_SSL_CONFIG_FILE>` by the real path of your OpenSSL config
file):

        <Location /api/action/dataset_acquired>
            SSLCACertificateFile    <PATH_TO_THE_CA_FILE_CREATED_PREVIOUSLY>
            SSLVerifyClient         require
        </Location>

Finally, you must restart your Apache server. To do so, execute the
following command:

    $ sudo service apache2 restart

From now own, you should consider that a valid certificate will be
required to call the notification callback. To generate a new
certificate you can execute the following lines (replace
`<PATH_TO_SSL_CONFIG_FILE>` by the real path of your OpenSSL config
file):

    $ openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
    $ openssl req -config <PATH_TO_SSL_CONFIG_FILE> -new -key client.key -out client.req
    $ openssl x509 -req -in client.req -CA ca.cer -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 101 -extfile <PATH_TO_SSL_CONFIG_FILE> -extensions client -days 365 -outform PEM -out client.cer
    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.cer -out client.p12

That's all! You notification callback is completely secure now! Enjoy it
:)

Tests
-----

This sofware contains a set of test to detect errors and failures. You
can run this tests by running the following command (this command will
generate coverage reports):

    python setup.py nosetests

**Note:** The `test.ini` file contains a link to the CKAN
`test-core.ini` file. You will need to change that link to the real path
of the file in your system (generally
`/usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/test-core.ini`).
