Non-plugin code
===============

`ckanext/dgu/schema.py` - mostly not used now
`ckanext/dgu/drupalclient.py` - for getting user info from Drupal
`dgu/ckanext/dgu/bin/` - scripts used at one time or another
`dgu/ckanext/dgu/commands/` - scripts used at one time or another

Install
=======

This is how to install ckanext-dgu, ckan and their dependencies into a
python virtual environment::

    virtualenv pyenv
    pip -E pyenv install -e git+https://github.com:okfn/ckanext-dgu.git#egg=ckanext-dgu
    pip -E pyenv install -e git+https://github.com/okfn/ckan.git#egg=ckan
    pip -E pyenv install -r pyenv/src/ckan/pip-requirements.txt
    pip -E pyenv install -r pyenv/src/ckanext-dgu/pip-requirements.txt

There are plenty of other little details about getting CKAN running
under Apache, SOLR config etc in the CKAN README.

When configuring Apache, DGU enables some modules SSL and for
ckanext-os. This is the complete list:: sudo a2enmod proxy wsgi headers
proxy\_http rewrite ssl

Configuration
=============

Different parts of the DGU extension require options to be set in the
CKAN configuration file (.ini) in the \[app:main\] section

To use the DGU package form specify::

    ckan.plugins = dgu_form dgu_package_form

For the Drupal RPC connection (for user data etc.) supply the hostname,
and credentials for HTTP Basic Authentication (if necessary)::

    dgu.xmlrpc_domain = drupal.libre.gov.fr:80
    dgu.xmlrpc_username = ckan
    dgu.xmlrpc_password = letmein

The DGU-version of the SOLR schema is required instead of the CKAN SOLR
schema. Whether you use a single or mult-core SOLR setup, you'll need a
link to the DGU SOLR schema like this::

    sudo ln -s /home/okfn/pyenv/src/ckanext-dgu/config/solr/schema-1.4-dgu.xml /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml

Initialise database
===================

Creating the database is as usual for CKAN::

    db=dgu
    db_user=dgu
    sudo -u postgres createuser -S -D -R -P $db_user
    sudo -u postgres createdb -O $db_user $db

And because we usually use ckanext-dgu also with ckanext-spatial, then
PostGIS needs setting up too::

    sudo -u postgres psql -d $db -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql -v ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK=on
    sudo -u postgres psql -d $db -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql
    sudo -u postgres psql -d $db -c "ALTER TABLE spatial_ref_sys OWNER TO $db_user;"
    sudo -u postgres psql -d $db -c "ALTER TABLE geometry_columns OWNER TO $db_user;"

(For more info on that, see the README for ckanext-spatial.)

Usage
=====

There is a front-page added to CKAN which describes the Catalogue APIs.
The usual CKAN front-page has been moved to /ckan/ .

e.g.::

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/ckan/

Scripts
=======

There are a number of command-line scripts for processing data. Over the
years they have been created in three different ways, but more recently
we've been focussing on just creating stand-alone python scripts.

To run a *python script* (in the ckanext/dgu/bin directory) you activate
the environment and then call it with python::

    . pyenv/bin/activate
    python ckanext/dgu/bin/dataset_change_publisher.py --help

To run a *console script* (listed in setup.py) you should activate the
environment first. For example::

    . pyenv/bin/activate
    bulk_delete --help

To run a *paster command* (listed in setup.py) you activate the
environment and if your CWD is not ckanext-dgu, specify it as the
plugin::

    . pyenv/bin/activate
    paster --plugin=ckanext-dgu prod --help

Assets
======

The DGU theme uses assets (images, javascript, css) from this repo and
the shared assets repo::

    https://github.com/datagovuk/shared_dguk_assets

Both repos should be cloned next to each other on developer and server
machines. If this is not possible then you need to set the
dgu.shared\_assets\_timestamp\_path config option to tell CKAN where the
shared assets timestamp file is. e.g.::

    dgu.shared_assets_timestamp_path = /vagrant/src/shared_dguk_assets/assets/timestamp

Assets are stored in the repo in 'source' form - the form easiest for
developers to edit them in. Before they can be served, Grunt must be run
on both repos to create the 'public' versions of these files. This does
concatenation, minification, compilation of the less, and recording a
timestamp (see Gruntfile.js for details).

Source:

    images:     ckanext/dgu/theme/src/images
    javascript: ckanext/dgu/theme/src/scripts
    css (less): ckanext/dgu/theme/src/css

And when you run grunt, you get:

    images:     ckanext/dgu/theme/public/images
    javascript: ckanext/dgu/theme/public/scripts
    css:        ckanext/dgu/theme/public/css
    timestamp:  ckanext/dgu/theme/timestamp.py

Read more about Grunt installation and running it:
<a href="https://github.com/datagovuk/shared_dguk_assets/blob/master/README.md" class="uri">https://github.com/datagovuk/shared_dguk_assets/blob/master/README.md</a>

The shared assets need to be served at /assets. On a deployment server,
setup nginx or apache to do this. A developer running under paster will
find that the shared assets are served autoimatically, as long as the
repo is cloned alongside ckanext-dgu and that this config option is not
set: dgu.shared\_assets\_timestamp\_path.

Tests
=====

\#\#\#\#\#Unit and functional tests

To test the DGU extension you need the setup with CKAN (see above) and
creation of a configured pyenv/src/ckan/development.ini (see
<a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/install-from-source.html" class="uri">http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/install-from-source.html</a>
).

To run the tests::

    {pyenv}/bin/activate
    cd {pyenv}/ckanext-dgu
    nosetests --ckan ckanext/dgu/tests/

or run them from another directory by specifying the test.ini::

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons={pyenv}/src/ckanext-dgu/test.ini {pyenv}/src/ckanext-dgu/ckanext/dgu/tests/

You can either run the 'quick and dirty' tests with SQLite or more
comprehensively with PostgreSQL. Set `--with-pylons` to point to the
relevant configuration - either `test.ini` or `test-core.ini` (both from
the ckanext-dgu repo, not the ckan one). For more information, see
<a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/install-from-source.html" class="uri">http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/install-from-source.html</a>
.

\#\#\#\#\#Browser tests

Selenium is used to test a site is operating to a basic minimum
standard, and specific checks on javascript elements.

To run the Selenium tests, TODO

Troubleshooting
===============

\#\#\#\#\#Address and Connection errors

-   `socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use`
-   `error: [Errno 111] Connection refused`

These errors usually means a previous run of the tests has not cleaned
up the Mock Drupal process. You can verify that::

    $ ps a | grep mock_drupal
    4748 pts/8    S      0:00 /home/dread/hgroot/pyenv-dgu/bin/python /home/dread/hgroot/pyenv-dgu/bin/paster --plugin=ckanext-dgu mock_drupal run -q

Now kill it before running the tests again::

    $ kill 4748

\#\#\#\#\#Config errors

-   `DrupalXmlRpcSetupError: Drupal XMLRPC not configured.`

The missing settings that result in this error are to be found in
{pyenv}/src/ckanext-dgu/test-core.ini which is also imported into
{pyenv}/src/ckanext-dgu/test.ini, so make sure you are specifying either
of these config files in your nosetests `--with-pylons` parameter.

-   `ckan.lib.search.common.SearchIndexError: HTTP code=400, reason=ERROR: [f752f33380e3eec1379cfb89e0fdded8] multiple values encountered for non multiValued field parent_publishers: [london-borough-of-barnet, local-authorities]`

This is due to SOLR using the CKAN SOLR schema, rather than the specific
DGU one. Change it using the `ln -s` command above, followed by stopping
and starting SOLR.
